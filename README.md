*Staging ground for QIIME 2 development*

This repository serves as a staging ground for the next major version of
[QIIME](http://qiime.org/) (i.e., QIIME 2), which will be a complete redesign
and reimplementation of the package.

**Note:** This repository exists mainly for developers and is not intended for
users or production. It will be transitioned to the canonical QIIME repo
([biocore/qiime](https://github.com/biocore/qiime)) when the package is ready
to be released. This package is under active development and all functionality
should be treated as **pre-alpha**.
